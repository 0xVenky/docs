# Oracles

<Subtitle>
    Oracles relay condition outcomes and real-world data to KPI tokens.

Generally speaking, oracles are entities that connect a certain smart contract
to external systems, making it able to access real-world data and implement
logic that relies on that.

The same concept applies to Carrot. Oracles are implementation of logic (in the
form of templates) that can feed KPI tokens real-world data about a certain
condition (such as its outcome).
