subtitle: Oracles: Bridging Real-World Data to KPI Tokens
---

Oracles serve as the bridge between smart contracts and external systems,
enabling access to real-world data and the implementation of logic based on that
data.

Carrot adopts the same concept of oracles. In Carrot, oracles are implemented as
templates that provide KPI tokens with real-world data pertaining to specific
conditions, such as their outcomes.
