# KPI tokens

<Subtitle>KPI tokens implement incentivization strategies.</Subtitle>

We can say that KPI tokens and their templates are the main logic piece in
Carrot, the ones that have full control over the incentivization strategies.

They represent on-chain the condition that the user wants to incentivize, can
take in collateral(s) and they have attached oracles that relay information to
them regarding condition outcomes.

Based on these outcomes, they can freely decide what to do about the
collateral(s) and where to allocate it.

In this sense, KPI tokens are the heart of any KPI token campaign.
