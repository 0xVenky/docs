subtitle: Implementing Incentivization Strategies

KPI tokens, along with their templates, form the core logic of Carrot, providing
full control over incentivization strategies.

These tokens represent the on-chain manifestation of the conditions users aim to
incentivize and the corresponding collaterals they can accept. Attached oracles
relay information to KPI tokens regarding condition outcomes.

Based on these outcomes, KPI tokens autonomously determine the appropriate
actions to take regarding the collaterals and their allocation.

As such, KPI tokens serve as the central component of any KPI token campaign,
embodying its essence.
