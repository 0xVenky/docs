subtitle: Get started with Carrot and its core principles.

Carrot is a platform that enables flexible and efficient incentivization,
focusing on what truly matters to you in a capital-efficient manner. Whether
you're a protocol or an individual user, Carrot can assist you in reaching your
goals by incentivizing specific behaviors.

## How Carrot Works

In Carrot, incentivization is achieved through **KPI token campaigns**. These
campaigns consist of the following key components:

-   **Goal**: Each KPI token campaign defines a target that requires efficient
    incentivization.
-   **Condition**: Goals are transformed into conditions that Carrot uses to
    assess their achievement. More details on this step will be provided later
    in the documentation.
-   **Collateral(s)**: Collaterals are rewards granted to campaign participants
    when the goal is attained. Unlocking conditions for collaterals are specific
    to each template (templates are explained later in the documentation).
-   **KPI tokens**: KPI tokens represent a claim to all or part of the
    collateral once the goal is fully or partially achieved.
-   **Oracle(s)**: Carrot utilizes oracles to relay real-world condition
    outcomes onto the blockchain. Oracles play a crucial role in finalizing the
    KPI token campaigns.

Several of these concepts are implemented on-chain as entities, utilizing
templates. Templates empower Carrot to offer highly adaptable incentivization
strategies suitable for various use cases. The concept of templates is further
elaborated in the next section.
