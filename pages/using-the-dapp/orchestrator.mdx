subtitle: The features of the Carrot orchestrator.
---

The base Carrot dapp allows users to interact with Carrot templates, and as such
it acts like an orchestrator. Two main pages are implemented at the moment, and
details about their functionality is given below.

## Homepage

The orchestrator's homepage is structured in a simple way with 3 distinct
sections. You can check out:

-   **A standard hero with an informative video**: the standard homepage hero
    when no featured campaign is present features an explanation video on how
    Carrot can help make easy incentivization easier.
-   **The featured campaigns**: the Carrot team might decide to feature some
    campaigns from partners from time to time. These campaigns will be shown at
    the top of the homepage.
-   **The latest campaigns**: the latest 5 campaigns are shown in the next
    section. These are continuously updated and you can see what's going on in
    the Carrot ecosystem at a glance..
-   **KPI token templates**: a selection of KPI token templates through which
    you can create campaigns. This section might not always be present on a
    given network, since it depends on whether multiple templates are actually
    deployed or not. If only one template is deployed, the section won't show by
    default.

## Campaigns page

The campaigns page lets you browse through created campaigns in a simple way.
You can optionally filter by state (active, expired, finalized) or by some text
of choice, and you can sort the queried results in ascending or descending order
depending on the creation date of the campaign.

These are the two main pages the Carrot orchestrator implements. The rest of its
job is to bring templates to users in an enjoyable format. As such, the next
sections will go into detail describing how to interact with the official first
party Carrot templates. In most cases, that's what the average user will deal
with the most on the Carrot dapp.
