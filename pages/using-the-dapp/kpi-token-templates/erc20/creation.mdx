To create a KPI token through the Carrot dapp, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Carrot dapp's homepage.
2. There are two ways to initiate the creation of a KPI token:
    - Option 1: Click on the "Create Campaign" button in the hero section of the
      homepage.
    - Option 2: Scroll down to the "Templates" section and locate the ERC20 KPI
      token template. Click on the "Use Template" button.
3. After clicking on "Use Template," a fullscreen modal will appear, loading the
   creation form from the template's latest version.
4. Fill in the creation form based on the following guidelines:

### General information

-   Title: Provide a short and memorable title for the campaign that conveys its
    purpose.
-   Description: Write a detailed description of the campaign using the in-app
    editor, which supports Markdown. Include all relevant information about the
    campaign's goal and how to measure its achievement.
-   Tags: Add tags that can help with discoverability.
-   Expiration: Set the expiration date for the KPI token. This protects the
    creator from unresponsive oracles. If the token is not finalized by the
    expiration date, the collateral (minus any minimum payout) will be returned
    to the creator.
-   ERC20 token name, symbol, and supply: Specify the information for creating
    and minting the on-chain ERC20 tokens that represent a claim to the
    collateral. Choose the details based on what you want to incentivize.

### Collaterals

-   Select up to 5 ERC20 tokens as collaterals. You can also set a minimum
    payout.
-   To add a collateral, select a token from the token selector on the left side
    of the form.
-   Use the number input to specify the collateral amount and the input below it
    for the minimum payout.
-   You can click the "max" text next to the balance to quickly select the
    maximum amount available in your connected wallet.
-   A protocol fee will be applied to the collaterals, and its value will be
    displayed in the collateral picker box.
-   The minimum payout should be less than the collateral amount minus any
    protocol fee.
-   Once you're satisfied with the amounts, click the "add to campaign" button
    to move the values to the collateral table below.
-   To remove a collateral entry, click the "x" icon next to the collateral row.
-   Adding a collateral with the same token as an existing row will overwrite
    the existing row.
-   After finalizing the collaterals, click the "next" button.

### Oracle configuration

-   By default, the Reality.eth v3 oracle template is selected.
-   Configure the fields based on the Reality.eth v3 oracle template creation
    form.
-   Once you're satisfied with the oracle configuration, click the "next"
    button.

### Outcome configuration

-   Choose between categorical and scalar configurations based on the type of
    condition you want.
-   For a "yes/no" type condition, enable the "binary" switch.
-   For a range-type condition, disable the "binary" switch and enter the lower
    and higher bound values manually.
-   Review the outcome configuration to ensure it matches your intended setup.
-   Click the "next" button.

### Deployment

-   Two steps are required to deploy the KPI token on-chain:
    -   Collateral(s) approval: Approve all the selected collaterals for usage
        by the created KPI token.
        -   Click the "Approve (currently approved token symbol)" button until
            all collaterals are approved.
        -   The "create" button will become enabled.
    -   Creation: Click the "create" button to deploy the KPI token.

Once the create transaction has been validated on-chain, you
