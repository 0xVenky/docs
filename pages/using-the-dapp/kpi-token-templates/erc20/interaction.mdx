subtitle: Interact with an ERC20 KPI Token Campaign
---

To interact with a KPI token, simply visit the token's **page** by clicking the
"view campaign" button on a KPI token campaign created using the ERC20 KPI token
template.

The token's page is structured into three main sections:

## General Information

The first section, the hero section, provides important information about the
campaign, including:

-   **Title**: The title of the campaign displayed at the top of the page.
-   **Owner**: The current owner of the campaign.
-   **Description**: A detailed description of the campaign, explaining its
    purpose and how the end results are calculated (if applicable).
-   **Rewards**: The current amount of rewards available in the campaign. This
    value reflects any rewards that have already been claimed or sent back to
    the KPI token owner.
-   **Minimum Payouts**: The minimum amount of rewards guaranteed to be paid out
    to KPI token holders, regardless of the campaign's condition.
-   **KPI Token**: The on-chain name and symbol of the ERC20 token representing
    the collateral tied to the unlocking condition.
-   **Initial Supply**: The initial amount of ERC20 tokens minted when the
    campaign was created. This value doesn't account for redemptions or token
    burnings.
-   **Current Supply**: The current supply of the ERC20 tokens, considering any
    redemptions or token burnings.
-   **Expiration Time**: The remaining time until the KPI token expires. For
    more information on expiration, refer to the generic information section
    about the template.

## Wallet Position Card

The wallet position card displays information specific to the currently
connected wallet (if available). It includes:

-   **Guaranteed Rewards**: The amount of rewards guaranteed for redemption
    based on minimum payouts and the current KPI token balance in the connected
    wallet.
-   **Maximum Rewards**: The total amount of rewards that can be unlocked if the
    campaign's condition is fully reached, based on the connected wallet's KPI
    token balance.
-   **Balance**: The current balance of the campaign's KPI token in the
    connected wallet.
-   **Claimable Rewards**: The rewards that can currently be claimed by the
    connected wallet.

The "actions" section at the bottom of the card changes depending on the state
of the KPI token. The possible states and associated actions are:

-   **Not Finalized and Not Expired**: If the token hasn't expired or been
    finalized, the user is informed that no actions can be taken at the moment.
    If manual intervention is required, such as with Reality.eth oracle, the
    user is instructed to use the oracle page section below to help finalize the
    KPI token.
-   **Finalized Without Balance**: If the KPI token has been finalized but the
    connected wallet has no balance of it, no actions are possible.
-   **Finalized With Balance but No Redemption Possible**: If the KPI token has
    been finalized, the connected wallet has a balance, but redemption is not
    possible, the user is presented with two choices: either do nothing or burn
    the KPI tokens by clicking the displayed action button.
-   **Finalized With Balance and Redemption Possible**: If the KPI token has
    been finalized, the connected wallet has a balance, and redemption is
    possible, the user is provided with a button to redeem their rewards.
-   **Expired Without Balance**: If the KPI token has expired and the connected
    wallet has no balance of it, no actions can be taken.
-   **Expired With Balance**: Two scenarios are possible in this case. If the
    KPI token had minimum payouts specified, those will be paid out regularly,
    and a "redeem" action will be available. If no minimum payouts were
    specified, the user will be given the option to burn their
