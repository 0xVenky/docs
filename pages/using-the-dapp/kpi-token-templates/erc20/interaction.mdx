subtitle: Interact with an ERC20 KPI token campaign
---

Interacting with a KPI token can be done through the token's **page**. Opening a
token's page is as simple as clicking the "view campaign" button on a KPI token
campaign created using the ERC20 KPI token template.

The page is generally structured in three different sections:

-   General information
-   Wallet position card
-   Oracle page card

In the sections below more detail is given for each of the section

## General information

The first section of the campaign page (the hero section) is populated with
information regarding the campaign at hand. In particular:

-   **Title**: the campaign's title will be displayed right at the top of the
    page, just on top of the campaign's card.
-   **Owner**: the campaign's current owner.
-   **Description**: the campaign's description, that goes into details about
    what the campaign is about and optionally how the end results must be
    calculated.
-   **Rewards**: the campaign's rewards. This is the current rewards amount,
    meaning that if some rewards have already been claimed/sent back to the KPI
    token owner, this value will reflect it.
-   **Minimum payouts**: the campaign's minimum payouts (the amount of rewards
    that are guaranteed to be paid out to KPI token holders in any
    circumstance).
-   **KPI token**: this is the on-chain name and symbol of the ERC20 token
    representing the collateral tied to the unlocking condition.
-   **Initial supply**: the amount of ERC20 tokens minted when the campaign was
    created (chosen by the campaign's creator). This value doesn't take into
    account redemptions and token burnings.
-   **Current supply**: the current ERC20 supply taking into account redemptions
    and token burnings.
-   **Expiration time**: the time to the KPI token expiration. To know more
    about the concept of expiration check out the generic information section
    about the template.

## Wallet position card

The wallet position card displays position information for the currently
connected wallet (and as such it won't be displayed if no wallet is connected).
In particular the shown information includes:

-   **Guaranteed rewards**: this value is calculated based on minimum payouts
    and the current KPI token balance of the connected wallet. These are rewards
    that are guaranteed to be redeemable once the KPI token finalizes, no matter
    what.
-   **Maximum rewards**: the full reward amount to be unlocked if the campaign's
    condition is fully reached, depending on the connected wallet's balance of
    the KPI token.
-   **Balance**: the campaign's KPI token balance of the connected wallet.
-   **Claimable rewards**: the currently claimable rewards of the connected
    wallet.

Additionally, an "actions" section is there at the bottom of the card, changing
depending on the KPI token's state.

The possible states and values shown in this section are:

-   **Not finalized and not expired**: if the token hasn't expired but is not
    yet finalized, a text is displayed telling the user pretty much nothing can
    be done unless the KPI token either expires or gets finalized. The user will
    be instructed to use the oracle page section below in the page to help
    finalize the KPI token, if applicable (in case the used oracle for the
    campaign needs manual intervention, such as when using Reality.eth).
-   **Finalized without balance**: if the KPI token has been finalized but the
    connected wallet has no balance of it, the user is told, but no action is
    possible.
-   **Finalized with balance but no redemption possible**: if the KPI token has
    finalized, the connected wallet has some balance of it, but no redemption is
    possible, the user is presented with 2 choices: either do nothing, or burn
    the KPI tokens by clicking the displayed action button.
-   **Finalized with balance and redemption possible**: if the KPI token has
    finalized, the connected wallet has some balance of it, and redemption is
    possible, the user is presented with a button he can click to redeem his
    rewards.
-   **Expired without balance**: if the KPI token has expired and the connected
    wallet has no balance of it, nothing can be done.
-   **Expired with balance**: two different scenarios are possible here. If the
    KPI token had some minimum payouts, these will be paid out to users
    regularly, and as such a "redeem" action will be possible. If no minimum
    payouts were specified the user will be presented with an option to burn his
    KPI tokens, which have expired worthless.

## Oracle page card

This section is dedicated to the frontend for the oracle the KPI token campaignc
reator picked while creating the campaign. The KPI token template has no direct
control over this, it just allocates part of the page to render the oracle's
frontend, and as such specific documentation for this portion of the template
strictly depends on the oracle picked to resolve the campaign and its page
frontend documentation.

To know more on this check out the oracles section of the documentation.
