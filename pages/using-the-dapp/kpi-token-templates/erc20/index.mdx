    Composable and flexible ERC20 KPI tokens that can easily be distributed via
    farming or airdrops.
---

This token template lets anyone create ERC20 tokens that can easily be
distributed via farming or airdrops, and that can be backed by multiple ERC20
collaterals ties to user-defined conditions. The following sections will go in
detail over the characteristics of the template and its functionality.

## Collaterals

The template accepts up to 5 ERC20 token amounts as collaterals. These ERC20
tokens will be unlocked (all or in part, depending on how the condition is set
up) at finalization time and either sent back to the KPI token owner or unlocked
for KPI token holders to redeem (or both, as we'll see in subsequent sections).

Additionally, the concept of minimum payouts is supported. Minimum payouts
represent an amount of collateral that will always be paid out to KPI token
holders at finalization or expiration time regardless of the goal's current
condition (reached or not reached).

## Conditions (oracles)

The template supports up to 5 different oracles relaying back condition results.
With the current frontend implementation of the creation form (see below for
more details on upcoming features), each condition governs an equal part of the
underlying collateral.

Let's run a couple examples to make the last sentence clearer and explain a
couple different scenarios:

1. Let's say we have a simple ERC20 KPI token set up with a single oracle and
   1,000,000 DAI as collateral. In this case the oracle "governs" the full
   1,000,000 DAI collateral, meaning that the result relayed back by the oracle
   is the only piece of data the template will use to determine how much of the
   collateral to unlock for KPI token holders to redeem and how much to send
   back.
2. In a KPI token that has the same 1,000,000 DAI single collateral as above,
   but with 2 oracles, the template now has 2 pieces of data to work with, and
   each one of these pieces of data will govern 50% of the collateral, so
   500,000 DAI for the first oracle and 500,000 DAI for the second one.
3. In a more complex example of a multi-collateral multi-oracle KPI token that
   has 1,000 DAI and 2 WETH as collaterals and 2 oracles, the template again has
   2 pieces of data to work with, but this time each one of these pieces of data
   will govern 50% of EACH collateral, so 500 DAI and 1 WETH for the first
   oracle and 500 DAI and 1 WETH for the second one.

You can see from the last example above how if multiple oracles are applied to a
multiple colleteral KPI token, each one of the oracles governs a portion of each
different collateral.

## Finalization logic

The template implements its own finalization logic based on bounds, which makes
it flexible to adapt to any need.

Bounds can be set to instruct the template on how to interpret results relayed
back by oracles. This unlocks the possibility to have both categorical (yes/no)
and scalar goals (range) to be expressed in a seamless way when creating the KPI
token.

In the categorical case, the template will only interpret oracle answers in 2
distict ways: yes or no. If the answer from the oracle is interpreted as a YES
(goal reached) the collaterals will be fully unlocked for KPI token holders to
redeem, while if the answer is NO (goal not reached), the collaterals minus any
minimum payout (see the collaterals section above for an explanation on minimum
payouts) will be sent back to the KPI token owner.

condition weighting)
