subtitle: Maximizing Your Experience with the Carrot dApp
---

The Carrot dApp empowers users to interact with existing incentivization
campaigns or create new ones using officially registered templates.

As an orchestrator of registered templates, the dApp facilitates your
interaction with the templates themselves. Carrot strives to make the concept of
templates transparent, providing a consistent and simplified user experience.

This documentation is divided into two parts: one that provides instructions for
performing generic actions on the dApp, and another that offers guidance on how
to interact with specific templates:

-   Generic Actions Documentation
-   ERC20 KPI Token Template Instructions
-   Reality.eth v3 Oracle Template Instructions
