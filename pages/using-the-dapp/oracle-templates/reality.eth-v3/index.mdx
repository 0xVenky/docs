title: Reality.eth v3 oracle template
subtitle:
    A crowdsourced, decentralized and flexible oracle that leverages Reality.eth
    v3.
---

This oracle template acts as an adapter to the Reality.eth v3 protocol, allowing
the creation of arbitrary goals/conditions through it. By leveraging Reality.eth
v3, there's no restriction on the type of condition to be used on the KPI token
to which this oracle is applied, since any goal can be oraclized through
Reality.eth. A crowdsourced process will determine the final outcome to the goal
and guarantee the correctness of the final value through strong crypto
incentives. Once the final answer is known, the oracle template will relay it
back to the KPI token to which it is attached, triggering the oracle's
finalization in the process.

To know more about how Reality.eth makes crowdsourced generalized oracles
possible, check out the platform's docs
