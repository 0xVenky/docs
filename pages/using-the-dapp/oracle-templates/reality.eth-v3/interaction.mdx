subtitle: Interact with a Reality.eth v3 oracle instance
---

The "page" component for a Reality.eth v3 oracle will be visible in any KPI
token page that has used at least one Reality.eth v3 oracle. From there, you'll
be able to interact with the oracle.

Here you will be able to see generic information about the oracle, in
particular:

-   **Arbitrator**: the arbitrator that was picked while creating the oracle.
    This is the arbitrator that will determine the final answer if asked to.
-   **Timeout**: the picked answer's timeout. The timeout is the amount of time
    that passes between when an answer being posted and when it is considered
    final. This is also the time any user interested in answering the question
    has to override an already present answer before it is finalized. For
    example, if the answer timeout is 30s and an answer is posted now, it will
    be considered final in 30s barring any question override, that must happen
    in these 30s.
-   **Direct oracle link**: if for any reason the Carrot oracle page is not
    allowing the user to post an answer, a direct link to the Reality.eth dapp
    (when supported) is offered to increase the availability of the oracle. The
    link can also be used to double-check that all the shown parameters are
    correct.
-   **Current answer**: this is the current highest-bond answer that has been
    submitted to the question, if there's any. If no answer has been given yet,
    it will be reflected in this value.
-   **Finalizing in**: this is a countdown to when the currently highest-bond
    answer will be considered final. It also represents the time any answerer
    has to override the current answer if they consider it incorrect.
-   **Bonded amount**: this is the native currency amount that has been bonded
    alongside the currently answered. It represents the level of conviction the
    answerer has in the given answer. At least double this amount in the chain's
    native currency will need to be paid to override the answer.
-   **Question**: this is the question's text.

The remaining part of the oracle page can show one of two things depending on
the question's state: if the opening timestamp is set in the future (i.e., the
question is not yet accepting answers), a countdown is shown to inform users
when it will, in fact, be possible to start posting answers.

If instead, the question is currently open and accepts answers, an answer form
will be shown depending on which kind of answer type was picked while creating
the oracle.

The section below goes into more details regarding the multiple available answer
forms and how they work.

## Answer forms

Answer forms can be used by users to interact with the question at hand and
provide an answer to it when applicable. The answer types generally depend on
how the question was configured when asked, but 2 values, in particular, will
always be available to answer with:

-   **Invalid question**: if anyone thinks the asked question cannot be answered
    correctly due to how the question itself was structured, they can answer
    with this option. This answer will always result in the goal being attached
    to the oracle to be resolved as if it was not reached.
-   **Answered too soon**: if you think it's too soon to correctly answer the
    question because some event still has to happen, you can pick this answer.
    Once a question has this answer as finalized, it is brought to a special
    state where it can be reopened by anyone in the future by clicking a button
    once the needed events have materialized and enough information is present
    to correctly answer the question. This process can be repeated n times
    without limit if the reopened question still can't be answered due to
    time-related constraints.
